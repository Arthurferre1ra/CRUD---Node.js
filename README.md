<p>A CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application is a software system that allows users to perform the four basic operations of data persistence. These operations include:

Create: Adding new records to the system. For example, creating a new user in a user management system.
Read: Retrieving and viewing existing records. For example, viewing the list of products in an inventory system.
Update: Modifying existing records. For example, updating customer information in a CRM system.
Delete: Removing records from the system. For example, deleting a purchase order from an order management system.
These operations are fundamental to most data management systems and are implemented across various technologies and platforms. A CRUD application can be used in various contexts, such as databases, web systems, mobile applications, and more, facilitating efficient management and manipulation of information.</p>
